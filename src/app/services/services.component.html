							<p>The process of hiring suitable candidates according to their knowledge and skills in an organisation is termed as
								staffing</p>

							<h4>HUMAN RESOURCE SERVICES</h4>
							<p>Human resources are the people who make up the workforce of an organization, business sector, or economy. "Human capital"
								is sometimes used synonymously with "human resources", although human capital typically refers to a more narrow view
								(i.e., the knowledge the individuals embody and economic growth). Likewise, other terms sometimes used include "manpower",
								"talent", "labour", "personnel", or simply "people". A human-resources department (HR department) of an organization
								performs human resource management, overseeing various aspects of employment, such as compliance with labour law
								and employment standards, administration of employee benefits, and some aspects of recruitment and dismissal.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>HR TRAINING &amp; DEVELOPMENT</h4>
							<p>Human Resource Development (HRD) is the framework for helping employees develop their personal and organizational
								skills, knowledge, and abilities. HRD is one of the most significant opportunities that employees seek when they
								consider you as an employer. The ability, and encouragement, to continue to develop their skills help you to retain
								and motivate employees. Human Resource Development includes such opportunities as employee training, employee career
								development, performance management and development, coaching, mentoring, succession planning, key employee identification,
								tuition assistance, and organization development.</p>
